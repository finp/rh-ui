= Welcome to the new rh Docs!
:page-layout: home
:!sectids:

The new documentation site, now in Beta, is a huge leap forward in our content strategy.
As we work out the kinks, we'd love to get your feedback on what we're doing well, and what we could be doing better.
To let us know, please use the btn:[Feedback?] button at the bottom-right corner of any page, or send an email to docs@rh.com.
We look forward to hearing from you!

Looking for the old documentation site?
You can find it over at the https://developer.rh.com[Developer Portal].
